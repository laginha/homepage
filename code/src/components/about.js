        <p> I am a software developer passionate about new technologies and eager to learn and apply new knowledge on promising and interesting projects.</p>
      <p> I am mostly drawn to projects that promotes transparency and openness. That led me to work in the open data ecosystem through the One.Stop.Transport platform, with a very strong focus on quality and innovation from its start to finish. In the future I want to be able to say that I made a dent in open data and help shape the world somehow.</p>
      <p> On my free time, I have been contributing to open source with several projects, mainly within the Django community. </p>
